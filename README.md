# SleepyAddon

A Meteor Client **cleaning & utility** addon.

## Modules

- **AntiCheat**  
  Manages internal addon settings. Most users can leave this on default.  
  *Note:* It effectively behaves like an always-on module, so enabling/disabling it usually doesn’t matter.

- **AirPlace**  
  Place the block in your hand anywhere (including mid-air). Range is configurable.

- **Printer**  
  A Litematica-style printing tool integrated into SleepyAddon. It can:
  - Automatically place schematic blocks in survival
  - Automatically mine **wrong** and **extra** blocks (blocks that shouldn’t be there according to the schematic)

- **SilentMine**  
  A packet/silent mining module for **2b2t**, designed to make mining smoother, and includes support for the **Grim AntiCheat double-mine exploit**.
